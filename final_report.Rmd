\textbf{Abstract:} This report analyzes trends surrounding intergenerational households in the United States which consists of about 1% of the US population.[^1] First, it describes a model that predicts the odds of a person living in an intergenerational household given a set of demographic attributes. Specifically, it analyzes the association between geographic region and intergenerational households, finding that different regions have different odds of intergenerational households. Next, it looks at the association between income and intergenerational households and determines that there is a negative association between the two variables. Then, the report focuses on relationships within intergenerational households, looking at the association between income and region. Intergenerational households in different regions tend to have different incomes.

#Introduction
Intergenerational households, defined as households with three or more generations living under the same roof, are a diverse and complicated subset of our population and number about 30 million.[^1]  Intergenerational households have different needs than traditional households, particularly in terms of healthcare and government programs for families. We hope our study provides insights into this unconventional family form. We developed two models. Our first model seeks to predicts the odds of living in an intergenerational household given a set of demographic attributes. Our primary question revolves around region of the household. Our secondary question examines the relationship between income and odds of living in an intergenerational household. Our second model focuses on trends within intergenerational households. This model addresses our tertiary question which looks within intergenerational households. Within these intergenerational households, we seek to assess if there are differences in household incomes in different regions of the country.

#Methods
We collected our data from the American Community Survey 2016.[^2] This is a weighted, 1-in-100 national random sample of the US population. From the data, we created two different models, a multiple logistic regression with odds of being an intergenerational household as a binary response variable (first model) and a multiple linear regression from the data only consisting of intergenerational households with household income as the quantitative response variable. 
  In our first and second models, we included the number of people living in the household, the household income (in dollars), age of the head of household (in years), whether the house is on a farm, number of children under 5, region (Northeast, South, West, Midwest)[^3], and race of the head of household (White, Black, Native American, Asian, a different race, and two or more races). In the first model we included the interaction between number of people and number of children under 5 and in the second model we included the interaction between the number of people and region, race of head of household and region, computer access (yes or no), and same sex married couple (yes or no). 
  In order to determine the more effective variables to include in our primary model, we ran likelihood tests for each variable and interaction terms. For the second model, we removed our variables one at a time, and ran various nested F tests, finding that each time, the full model (the second model with the confounding variables) was needed. Next, we checked to see if both of our models met the required assumptions and conditions for performing regression analysis. While our first model met the conditions, our second model did not meet the condition of linearity. However, we proceeded with caution.

#Results
##Primary Question 
Using the Census regions in Figure 1, region is an explanatory variable predicting income of the intergenerational household. Looking at our first model, our null hypothesis is that region is not correlated with income within intergenerational households. 

```{r, include= FALSE}
primarymodel <- glm(MULTGEN ~ West + Midwest + South + AGE + HHINCOME + NUMPREC + NCHLT5 + NUMPREC*NCHLT5 + FARM + black + nativeamerican + asian +otherrace + twoormore , family=binomial, data = project_data)
summary(primarymodel)
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
exp(coef(primarymodel))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, probplot, fig.height= 2, fig.width= 3}
oddsdf <- data.frame(Region = c("Northeast", "West", "Midwest", "South"),
    Probability =c(.001418,.00144265,.001094,.001594), Odds = c(0.00142, .001445, .001095, .001597), OddsRatio = c("NA",  1.0163,0.7705,1.123))


kable(oddsdf, format="latex") 

  
```

For example, as shown in the table, a household in the West has, on average, 1.0163 times the odds of being intergenerational than a household in the Northeast, controlling for the variables above. Our multiple logistic regression with 3156472 degrees of freedom, gives us high z-values for the categorical variable region of 2.126, -30.796, and 16.388 and low p-values of 0.0335, <.001, and <.001 for West, Midwest, and South, respectively. From a nested likelihood test for region with 3 degrees of freedom, we obtain a chi-square value of 2825.4 and a corresponding p-value of <.001. Based on these low p-values (below our chosen alpha level of 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis. We have evidence that there is a statistically significant relationship between region and odds of an household being intergenerational, controlling for the set variables.

##Secondary Question

Our secondary question analyzes total household income as an explanatory variable, using the first model. Our null hypothesis is that income had no impact on the odds of being an intergenerational household.

For an increase of \$100,000 of total household income, on average, a family is 6% less likely to be intergenerational compared to a family that earns \$100,000 less, adjusting for the specified variables. Based on our multiple logistic regression with 3156472 degrees of freedom, we obtain a high z-value of -25.591 and p-value of <0.001 for the coefficient for household income. After running a likelihood test with 1 degree of freedom, we found a chi-square value of 3116.1 and p-value of <.001. Since the p-values from both tests are below our alpha level of 0.05, we can reject our null hypothesis. This test provides evidence that there is a statistically significant relationship between household income and odds of a household being intergenerational. But the relationship between income and logit (odds) was quite shallow: large changes in income only resulted in small changes in odds of being an intergenerational household.

##Tertiary Question
```{r, include=FALSE}
tertiarydata <- project_data %>%
  filter(MULTGEN == 1)

modeltertiary <- lm(HHINCOME~NUMPREC + Midwest*NUMPREC + South*NUMPREC + West*NUMPREC + AGE + FARM + NCHLT5 + black*NUMPREC + nativeamerican*NUMPREC + asian*NUMPREC + otherrace*NUMPREC + twoormore*NUMPREC + CINETHH + SSMC, data=tertiarydata)

summary(modeltertiary)
```

Our tertiary question analyzes the relationship between income and region by looking within intergenerational households, using our second model. Our null hypothesis is that region is not correlated with income within intergenerational households.

For an intergenerational household living in the Northeast, with 3 people (the minimum number required to have an intergenerational household), the predicted annual household income is \$50346.08. With each additional household member, in the Northeast, income is predicted to increase by $10386.65, adjusted for the variables above. For intergenerational households living in the Midwest with 3 people, the predicted annual household income is \$37730.06, with a predicted increase in income \$5856.6 per additional household member.  In the South, for 3 person intergenerational households, the predicted household income is \$38528.84, with an increase of \$5844.596 per member. In the West, 3 person intergenerational households are predicted to make \$42643.982, with an increase of \$7931.779 per additonal member. In our regression analysis of our second model, we found that the interaction terms between number of people living in the household and region are statistically significant, on 243,181 degrees of freedom. With p-values below .05, we can conclude that the slopes of our linear regression (number of people predicting income within intergenerational households) vary by region.

#Discussion
Intergenerational households are a unique subset within our culture that has yet to succumb to the image of the modern nuclear family that has spread across America. This investigation into the different factors associated with intergenerational families focuses on economic and geographic patterns.
  Our research indicates that different regions have statistically different odds of intergenerational households, and there is a negative relationship between income and odds of living in an intergenerational household. We conclude that intergenerational households living in different regions of the United States have statistically different incomes. In our models, we adjust for many different variables including race of the head of household and number of people in the household. However, there are numerous other variables that we do not use in our model that could also influence odds of being an intergenerational household or income of intergenerational households. Some of these statistics are not provided in the census we used (such as religion). We want to emphasize that, because our data is observational and not from an experiment, we can not prove causation between region or household income and odds of being an intergenerational household. Also, because the normality condition for the second model is not met, our analysis may not be entirely accurate. Nonetheless, it is both interesting and informative to attempt to understand the different factors associated with families who resist the social norm of a nuclear household.
